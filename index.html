<h1 id="title"> What Makes Up a Basketball: </h1>

<p> A basketball has 3 main components. </p>
<ol>
    <li> Nylon Outside Wrapping </li>
    <li> Polyester Thread Inside Wrapping </li>
    <li> Butyl Rubber Bladder </li>
</ol>
                                         
<p> Starting off with the outer wrapping, nylon, specifically nylon 6-6, has 2 strings of carbon, each 6 atoms long. </p>
<p> The polyester thread inside wrapping is made of ethylene glycol and adipi c acid. Ethlyene glycol has 2 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms, and adipic acid has 2 hydrogen atoms and 4 oxygen atoms. </p>
<p> The butyl rubber bladder is a synthetic rubber made of isobutylene and isoprene. Isobutylene has 4 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms, while isoprene has 5 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. 
<br> Together, they create butyl rubber, which has 9 carbon atoms and 16 hydrogen atoms. </p>
<br>
<p> The conversion factor I made is: </p>

<div>
<p>1 mol / 12.0107 grams or 12.0107 grams / 1 mol </p>
<p> 1 mol / 1.00794 grams or 1.00794 grams / 1 mol </p>
<p> 1 ball / 3628.74 grams or 3628.74 grams / 1 mol </p>
</div>

<p> Question 1) How many air molecules are in a standard size basketball, at regulation pressure? <br> 1 mol O = 15.9994 grams, the amount of air molecules inside of a standard size basketball, that has a circumference of 29 and â…ž inches, and a volume of 455.9 cubic inches, is 5.975*10^-26 grams. </p>

<p> Question 2) How many carbon atoms form the outside skin of the basketball? <br> 1 mol C = 12.0107 grams. The amount of carbon atoms that form the outside skin of the basketball is 4.96*10^23 grams. </p>

<p> Question 3) How many hydrogen atoms make up the inner wrapping of the basketball? <br> Ethlyene glycol has 2 hydrogen atoms and adipic acid has 2 hydrogen atoms, so together they have 4 hydrogen atoms. </p>

<br>
<p> 1 basketball @ 8 PSI (8 pounds / 1 ball) * (1 mol basketball / 3628.74 grams) * (82 mol C / 1 mol Basketball) * (6.022 * 10^23 C /1 mol C) = 4.96*10^23 Carbon Atoms </p>
